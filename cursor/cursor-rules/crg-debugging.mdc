# Debugging & Error Handling Standards

## Core Debugging Principles
- Consider multiple possible causes before deciding on a solution
- Do not jump to conclusions without evidence
- Make minimal necessary changes to fix issues
- Verify fixes with appropriate tests
- Document root causes and solutions

## Error Analysis Process
### Initial Assessment
- Reproduce the error consistently
- Identify exact error messages and codes
- Note the context and conditions when errors occur
- Document system state at time of error
- Create minimal reproducible examples

### Root Cause Analysis
- Perform thorough root cause analysis
- Consider both obvious and non-obvious factors
- Check logs and error traces completely
- Identify patterns in error occurrence
- Determine if error is systemic or isolated

### Solution Development
- Research similar issues in documentation
- Consult trusted web resources
- Review relevant Stack Overflow discussions
- Check GitHub issues for similar problems
- Consider multiple potential fixes

## Implementation Practices
- Make minimal necessary changes
- Modify as few lines of code as possible
- Maintain existing patterns and conventions
- Add appropriate error handling
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Dependency Management
- When updating dependencies:
  - Check latest versions on package repositories
  - Verify compatibility with existing dependencies
  - Review release notes for breaking changes
  - Test changes in isolated environment
  - Document version changes

## Testing Strategy
- Write tests before fixing bugs when possible
- Cover both expected and edge cases
- Maintain existing test integrity
- Never modify production code just for testability
- Use appropriate mocking and test isolation

## Documentation Requirements
- Document the exact error and symptoms
- Explain the root cause analysis
- Detail the implemented solution
- Note alternative solutions considered
- Update relevant documentation with findings
- Create knowledge base entries for recurring issues
