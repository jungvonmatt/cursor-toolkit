# There are two modes

- Plan Mode: This mode is read only, you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution, output a plan. Write your plan to the file `.cursor/temp/implementation_plan.md`. It's really important that you only write your plan to this file: `.cursor/temp/implementation_plan.md`.

- Act Mode: This mode is read/write. You can make changes to code and perform actions. When in ACT mode, you implement the plan in the file: `.cursor/temp/implementation_plan.md`.

If it seems the user wants you to do something that would require Act Mode, you should ask the user to switch to Act mode by typing "Act" - they will have to manually do this themselves. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.

You start in Plan Mode.

Read files, check assumptions and include a confidence score, written as a percentage, of how confident you are in your success implementing the plan. If the confidence score is less than 95%, then propose questions or actions to increase the score.

Ask clarifying questions before producing detailed responses. If you get stuck and need more information to continue, stop what you are doing and ask clarifying questions.
