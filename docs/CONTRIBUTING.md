# Contributing to AI DevKit

The AI DevKit is designed to maximize developer productivity and AI adoption across Jung von Matt. We welcome contributions that enhance ease of use, reduce manual work, and improve the developer experience.

## üéØ Core Contribution Principles

**The #1 priority for AI DevKit contributions is ease of use, improved developer experience, and increasing adoption of AI tooling across Jung von Matt.**

Every contribution should:

- ‚ú® Be super user-friendly
- üöÄ Reduce manual work for other developers
- ü§ñ Automate as much as possible
- üéØ Aim for one-click installation/usage where feasible
- üåç Be general-purpose (not project-specific), providing value to any Jung von Matt codebase.
- üì¶ Work with minimal developer input

## üìã What Can You Contribute?

We accept contributions to all areas of the AI DevKit:

1. **Cursor Rules** (`cursor/cursor-rules/`)
   - New AI behavior patterns
   - Improvements to existing rules
   - Technology-specific guidelines

2. **Workflows** (`workflows/`)
   - New development workflows
   - Enhanced AI assistant guidance
   - Cross-repository patterns

3. **Scripts** (setup/update scripts)
   - Automation improvements
   - Error handling enhancements
   - Cross-platform compatibility

4. **Documentation**
   - Clarity improvements
   - Additional examples
   - Troubleshooting guides

## üîç Contribution Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All contributions must be general-purpose. They should work across different codebases at Jung von Matt, not be specific to a single project.

## üé® Code Formatting

The AI DevKit uses Prettier for automatic code formatting to ensure consistent code style.

### Setup (Already Complete)

The project is configured with:

- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Husky** for Git hooks
- **lint-staged** for formatting only changed files on commit

### Usage

**Format all files:**

```bash
pnpm format
```

**Check formatting without changes:**

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

**Automatic formatting on commit:**
Files are automatically formatted when you commit changes. The pre-commit hook runs prettier on all staged files matching these patterns:

- `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx` - JavaScript/TypeScript files
- `*.json` - JSON files
- `*.css`, `*.scss` - Stylesheets
- `*.md` - Markdown files
- `*.yaml`, `*.yml` - YAML files

### Configuration

- **`.prettierrc`** - Prettier formatting rules
- **`.prettierignore`** - Files/folders to skip formatting
- **`.husky/pre-commit`** - Git hook configuration
